#Compute the area of trianlge 
#Area of triangle:  A = (b * h)/ 2
#Find A = ?

#taking "b" as a variable
#Adding int for number
#adding input so the user can add the base number
b = int(input("Enter Base: "))

#taking "h" as a variable
#Adding int for number
#adding input so the user can add the base number
h = int(input("Enter height: "))

#taking "Area" as a variable and adding "area of triagnle" formula.
Area =  (b * h)/ 2

#printing Area
print ("Area = " ,Area)
